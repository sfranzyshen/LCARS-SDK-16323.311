# Captains-Chair 15130.1

A DOMod based on the deleted scene from Nemesis.  

This DOMod uses the CSS zoom feature and should work on a wide array of devices.  Unless the aspect ratio is to severe compared to the original, 360x640, most devices are applicable.  

One of the features used is the Missed Called/Missed SMS functionality of DOMLauncher.  If these services are not on the device (say a tablet), DOMLauncher will be unhappy.  A tablet version will be released soon until a fix to the DOMLauncher plugin is put into place.

Use DOMLauncher 2.3.1+
