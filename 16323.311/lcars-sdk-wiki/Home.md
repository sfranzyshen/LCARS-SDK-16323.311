Wiki Guide 16323.311 (SDK 3.1.1)
 
The LCARS SDK comes in three parts:

1. Illustrator files for mockups and direct sizing porting.
2. Base CSS which is the minimal requirement to utilize the LCARS methodology.
3. JS API which is optional but useful for creating, managing and maintaining the interfaces.

The wiki assumed the JS API is utilized but all the classes and options are presented for any hardcoding of an interface.  

Provided with the LCARS SDK are three built interfaces: 

1. Random Color Generator - New color selection after every refresh and auto sizes with the built in zoom function.
2. Hardcoded - Same layout as the Color Generator but is hardcoded html with all JS removed.  Only powered by CSS.
3. Visual Guide - A reference and testing setup for all elements and their variants.

*NOTE*

When viewing interfaces in Firefox locally the font does not render correctly.  You must change the security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false in about:config but then your filesystem is exposed so use with caution.
