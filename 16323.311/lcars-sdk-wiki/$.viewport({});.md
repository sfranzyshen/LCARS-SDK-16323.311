<div class="description">
<p>The definition of a viewport within the SDK is the top most parent container that maintains an entire interface.  There is the ability to scale or zoom the whole interface or child areas with an interface</p>

<p>Firefox does not support zooming.  Zooming is mainly used because in Webkit, zoom maintains a vector based view where as scale will turn the view into a texture and can create blury issues.</p>

<p>While the call triggers only once, there is also placed as a part of the window.resize listener to continually trigger when the window is resized. </p>

<p>The max parameter disables the scaling when the UI is 1:1 to the viewport</p>
