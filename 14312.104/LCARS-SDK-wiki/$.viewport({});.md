<div class="description">
<p>The definition of a viewport within the SDK is the top most parent container that maintains an entire interface.</p>

<p>Currently there is only the scale version in play.  A stepping feature is in development but not ready for use.  While the call triggers only once, place it as a part of the window.resize listener to continually trigger when the window is resized. </p>

<p>The max parameter disables the scaling when the UI is 1:1 to the viewport</p>

<pre class="code hidden">
$(element).viewport('scale', {width:1080, height:1920, max:true});

window.onresize = function(event) {
    $(element).viewport('scale', {width:1080, height:1920, max:true});
}
